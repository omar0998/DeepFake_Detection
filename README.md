# DeepFake_Detection
Deepfake detection is an essential artificial intelligence field focused on the development 
of mechanisms for identifying and controlling the spread of synthetic media – false audio, 
visual, or combined content produced employing advanced machine learning systems. 
The term is combined from “deep learning” and “fake” because it describes deep neural 
networks manipulated to create highly plausible still and video images and audio 
recordings. It is urgent to acquire a new perspective of methodologies for detecting the 
systems since the rapidly changing horizon of produced artificial contents demands the 
creation of strong and scalable detection models. An effective approach to solving 
complex challenges is to facilitate interdisciplinary research and collaboration to maintain 
the unity and trustworthiness of details and counter the spread of fallacious information.
